<p><b>Bio</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

Donna Bernstein was born in New York. Largely
self-taught, in school<p></p>she held a one-woman show in the lobby of a local
theatre and sold three<p></p>pieces. This early success fed a passion for her art.
Studying privately with artist Robert Dash,<p></p>as well as at Hollins College in
Virginia, she continued to draw and paint from life and her<p></p>surroundings,
supplemented with studies in Japanese ink work and brush techniques.<p></p>

<p></p>After many successful years in business, in
1998 Donna and her husband,<p></p>a national level soccer coach, moved to McCall,
Idaho and began a new life.<p></p>The house they rented happened to have an available
garage studio….<p></p>it was there, surrounded by beauty and nature, wilderness and
horses, that she re-connected<p></p>to her art, and within three years began
marketing to numerous shows and<p></p>galleries throughout the country. Working on
technique at the Boise Art Museum she<p></p>sculpted. A number of these pieces have
been placed in permanent collections.<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>'Your art inspires thought.&quot;<p></p><p></p>

&quot;Your art draws me in for a much deeper experience; everytime I look I see
more!&quot;<p></p>
<p></p>
&quot;Your art has it all - motion and emotion.&quot;<p></p>
<p></p>
&quot;Your art is full of vitality, energy, on the inside moving out.&quot;</b><p></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Donna has been inspired by the ancient cave paintings of Altamira and Lascaux;<p></p>by Greek marble
sculpture and form; and by Impressionist color - the scale and freedom of<p></p>
Monet. Classical influences most impacting her work are Rosa Bonheur,
especially her definitive<p></p>piece, &quot;The Horse Fair&quot;, the abstract
expressionists Pollock, Frankenthaler and Mitchell, as well<p></p>as the color field
work of Mark Rothko. Georgia O’Keefe, and<p></p>the daring metal works of Deborah
Butterfield.<p></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>She has studied with such fine artists as
Robert Dash,</p>

<p>contemporary abstract
painter Christine Raymond, and modernist mixed media sculptor Sue Latta.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Donna's personal artistic blend and
stylization creates art that is modern in structure, yet deeply<p></p> intimate.<p></p>
